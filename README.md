# Todos
In this school assignment, we built a todo list in React. 

## Requirements
- Create a hardcoded list with custom todos
- Present the list on the screen with control, perhaps using a ul/li
- Able to remove a todo from the list
- Use at least one component
- Use localStorage to save the list.
- Maintain good structure in our code. Meaning self-explanatory variable names and function names, and no comments.
